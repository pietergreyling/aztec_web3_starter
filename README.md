# Getting Started with an Aztec Web3 Project

---

## Introduction

### The Purpose of this Learning Path   
The purpose of this tutorial repository is to provide a Web 3.0 Aztec Network getting started learning path for Web 2.0 developers who are new to working with Aztec technology and Web 3.0 in general.  

### An important note!

I include several screenshots in this tutorial.  

These screenshots are not necessarily applicable to your own personal developer path and experience.  

However, I offer them as a general guide.


### What is Aztec Network?  
Aztec is an open source layer 2 network that aims to bring scalability and privacy to Ethereum. It strives to enable affordable, private crypto payments via zero-knowledge proofs.

Privacy isn't just a human right, it's a tool for creativity. With privacy by default, the world of games, NFTs, and DeFi applications just got bigger. Aztec is an open source layer 2 network that aims to bring scalability and privacy to Ethereum. It strives to enable affordable, private crypto payments via zero-knowledge proofs. Aztec is built from the ground up to be privacy-first.

## Building the Aztec SDK Starter Code on macOS  

These notes record steps that were performed **on a macOS development laptop**.  

Other operating systems should have similar options to enable the equivalent operations.  

I use the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager on my macOS development laptop.

Package managers like [Homebrew for macOS](https://brew.sh/) have equivalents such as [Chocolatey for Windows](https://chocolatey.org/) and many others for Linux.  

Here is a list of software package management systems:

## Step-by-Step   

### [1] Read/Refer to these resources  

- Aztec Network Introduction 
  - [https://docs.aztec.network/](https://docs.aztec.network/) 
- The Aztec SDK Starter Repository
  - [https://github.com/critesjosh/aztec-sdk-starter](https://github.com/critesjosh/aztec-sdk-starter)

### [2] Install the SDK starter repository dependencies

  - [https://github.com/critesjosh/aztec-sdk-starter#requirements](https://github.com/critesjosh/aztec-sdk-starter#requirements)

For your reference; How to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), NodeJS and NPM on macOS   

  - [https://medium.com/@hayasnc/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew-b33780287d8f](https://medium.com/@hayasnc/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew-b33780287d8f)

I already have Homebrew on my system, so I will proceed with NodeJS, NPM and Yarn  

```
$ cd ~

# -- Node
$ brew install node
$ brew info node
$ brew info npm

# -- Yarn
$ brew install yarn
$ brew info yarn
```

![brew info yarn](./screenshots/brew-info-yarn.png?raw=true)

### [3] Clone the SDK starter repository from GitHub  

```
$ mkdir aztec
$ cd aztec
$ git clone https://github.com/critesjosh/aztec-sdk-starter.git
$ cd aztec-sdk-starter
$ ls -lh
```
